				h1 About UW Chatrooms
				p A simple multi-room chat application built using node.js as web server,
					| express3 as web framework, socket.io for real-time event handling, and jade
					| for templating.

				p I got this idea from a friend who wanted to create a chat web application
					| for a university campus in which each chat room could be representations of
					| a building, classroom, common area, or virtual study space. I wanted users to
					| be able to chat in seconds, with no login. I think there is an appeal in chatrooms
					| being a virtual representation of a physical area of space, even though this is
					| in no ways enforceable, it can still be very powerful in knowing that the people
					| that are in the same chat room as you are close to you.

				p I wrote this chat application for fun and to improve my programming skills.
					| With a hope that some people can use it and benefit from it.

				p This is and always will be a work in progress, please email me at
					a(href="mailto:davis@daviswang.com")  davis@daviswang.com 
					| if you have any questions, comments, or if you'd like
					| to submit a bug report.
